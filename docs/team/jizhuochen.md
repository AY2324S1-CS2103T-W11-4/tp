### Project: LinkTree

LinkTree is a CLI-based contact management solution for software professionals. 
Using our unique tag-based system, access contacts by roles and responsibilities 
instantly. With LinkTree, easily visualise the structure and team compositions, leaderships
of any software project, allowing you to instantly locate the target developer/ 
team that you are looking for in a sea of developers.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

  * Addition of the remark feature which acts as a short bio for developers.
