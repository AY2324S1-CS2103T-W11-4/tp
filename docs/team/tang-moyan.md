### Project: LinkTree

LinkTree is the top contact solution for software professionals.
Using our unique tag-based system, access contacts by roles and responsibilities instantly.
With LinkTree, swiftly connect with the right stakeholder,
ensuring smooth project execution and superior collaboration.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  - Implemented `tree` command which will show all the contact information as well as team
information in a tree structure in GUI.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&since=2023-09-22&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=Tang-Moyan&tabRepo=AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)

* **Project management**:
  - Defined the overall data structure and basic classes to be used for which to be modified
by other teammates later on.
  - Helping others with their questions and bugs.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  - Extended the "edit" feature such that users can not only edit personal information, but
also edit team name and team leader.

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Updated the user guide for "edit" related features and `tree` command.

    * Developer Guide:
        * Updated the UMl diagrams for our modifications in the Logic component.

* **Community**:
    * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): to be added soon
    * Contributed to forum discussions to be added soon
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class to be added soon
    * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other classmates.

a Identity code as and alternative.

* **Tools**:
