## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![UI Class Diagram](images/UML_images/UiDiagram.png)

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, 
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures 
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
[`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands, and it also 
displays the statistical information of how many developers and teams are there at the moment.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Team` object residing in the `Model`.


### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

![Logic Class Diagram](images/UML_images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

The display in UI is depended on the `CommandResult` returned by Logic component. 
For example, UI will have a **new window** for displaying "LinkTree" if command
`Tree` is received by the Logic component.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Delete Sequence Diagram](images/UML_images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)
<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

![Parser Class Image](images/UML_images/ParserClasses.png)

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component:
* stores the addressbook and teambook date i.e., all `Person` objects and `Team` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueTeamList` respectively).
* maintains a filtered list of `Person`, `Team` objects and stores the currently 'selected' `Person` or `Team` objects (eg., results of a search query) as a separate filtered list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Team>` that can be observed.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This part is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, this means that model should make sense on their own without depending on other components).
<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API**: [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

![Storage UML Diagram](images/UML_images/StorageUML.jpg)  

The `Storage` component:
- Can save address book data, user preference data, and team book data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- Inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `UserPrefStorage`, and `TeamBookStorage`, which means it can be treated as any one of them (if only the functionality of one is needed).
- Depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).


### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Feature: Create a new team

####  Introduction

The create new team feature is facilitated by the AddTeamCommand. It extends `Command` class.

The operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addTeam()`.

#### Usage
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add team behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and uses the `newteam` command and specifies a `teamname` and `teamLeader` name.



Step 2. The user executes the `newteam` command `newteam tn/Team1 tl/John` to create a new team `Team1` with `John` set as team leader.



Step 3. LinkTree provides a feedback based on whether the operation was successful or not.



<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#addTeam()`, so the `team` will not be saved to `TeamBook`.

</box>

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. Create a newteam parser class called `AddTeamCommandParser` to parse input from user. This implements the `Parser` interface for type `AddTeamCommand`
2. Create a `parse` method in `AddTeamCommandParser` that parses the user input and specify the user flags that are used `tn/` for teamName and `tl/` for teamLeader.
3. The flags for user input can be added to class `CliSyntax`.
4. For the `AddTeamCommand` class, specify the Command Word. In this case, it is `newteam`.
5. Add relevant messages for use cases like `Duplicate team creation` and `Person not found error`.
6. Implement the `execute` method in `AddTeamCommand`. Handle the cases where a team with specified `teamName` already exists and also one where specified `person` with given `teamLeaderName` does not exist.
7. Use the `Model#addTeam` and `Model#containsPerson` to do these checks.
8. Throw exception in the case where adding new team is not possible.
9. If not such exception is thrown, create the new team at this point. 
10. Run the `Model#addTeam` method to add the created team to TeamBook.
11. `Model#addTeam` calls `TeamBook#addTeam` which in turn calls `UniqueTeamList#add`. Finally this method calls the `ObservableList#add` which adds the `team` to the list.

<puml src="diagrams/AddTeamCommandDiagram.puml" width="574" />


#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Where the team is stored:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the teams in a separate class called UniqueTeamList.
  * Pros: Better use of OOP.
  * Cons: Multiple layers of abstraction(through Model, TeamBook, UniqueTeamList).

* **Alternative 2:** Store the teams in the same class as Persons in the class AddressBook.
  * Pros: Easier implementation.
  * Cons: Breaks principle of abstraction and OOP. Information hiding is also not done.


### Feature: Add developers to an existing team

####  Introduction

The add dev to team feature is facilitated by the AddDevToTeamCommand. It extends `Command` class.

The operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addToTeam()`.

#### Usage
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add team behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and uses the `dev2team` command and specifies a `teamname` and `developer` name.



Step 2. The user executes the `dev2team` command `dev2team tn/Team1 n/Jason` to add a developer `Jason` to the team `Team1`.



Step 3. LinkTree provides a feedback based on whether the operation was successful or not.



<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#addToTeam()`, so the specified `developer` will not be added to the `team`.

</box>

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. Create a dev2team parser class called `AddDevToTeamParser` to parse input from user. This implements the `Parser` interface for type `AddDevToTeamCommand`
2. Create a `parse` method in `AddDevToTeamParser` that parses the user input and specify the user flags that are used `tn/` for teamName and `n/` for developer name.
3. The flags for user input can be added to class `CliSyntax`.
4. For the `AddDevToTeamCommand` class, specify the Command Word. In this case, it is `dev2team`.
5. Add relevant messages for use cases like `Team not found`, `Duplicate developer`, `Developer is the teamleader` and `Developer not found` errors.
6. Implement the `execute` method in `AddDevToTeamCommand`. Handle the cases where a team with specified `teamName` does not exist and also one where specified developer to be added does not exist. 
7. You will also need to handle the cases where either the given developer is already in the team or the developer is currently the leader of the given team.
7. Use the `Model#InvalidAddToTeam`, `Model#containsPerson`, `Model#personAlreadyInTeam` and `Model#isLeaderOfTeam` methods to do these checks.
8. Throw exceptions in the cases where adding the developer is not possible.
9. If not such exception is thrown, add the developer to the given team at this point.
10. The `Model#addToTeam` method performs the addition of the developer to the specified team.

<puml src="diagrams/AddDevToTeamCommandDiagram.puml" width="1100"/>


#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Can a team leader also be a developer in his team? :**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Team leader of a team cannot be added as a developer in his team.

* **Alternative 2:** Store the teams in the same class as Persons in the class AddressBook.
* Generally, though a team leader also works on the code that he is in charge of, adding himself as a developer in the team that he manages would be redundant. Hence we settled with this current design.

### Feature: Remove an existing Team

#### Introduction

Removing an existing team feature is facilitated by the `DeleteTeamCommand`. It extends the `Command` class. 

The operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deleteTeam()`.

#### Usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the "Remove an existing team" feature behaves at each step.

##### Step 1

The user launches the application and uses the `deleteteam` command to specify the `teamname` they want to delete.

##### Step 2

The user executes the `deleteteam` command `deleteteam tn/Team1` to delete the team named `Team1`.

##### Step 3

LinkTree provides feedback based on whether the operation was successful or not.

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#deleteTeam()`, so the team will not be removed from `TeamBook`.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. Create a `deleteteam` parser class called `DeleteTeamCommandParser` to parse input from the user. This class implements the `Parser` interface for the type `DeleteTeamCommand`.

2. Create a `parse` method in `DeleteTeamCommandParser` that parses the user input and specifies the user flag used for `teamName` (e.g., `tn/` for teamName).

3. Add the flag for user input to the `CliSyntax` class.

4. For the `DeleteTeamCommand` class, specify the Command Word, which is `deleteteam`.

5. Add relevant error messages for use cases like "The team name provided is invalid".

6. Implement the `execute` method in `DeleteTeamCommand`. Handle cases where a team with the specified `teamName` does not exist.

7. Use the `Model#deleteTeam` method to perform these checks.

8. Throw exceptions in the case where deleting the team is not possible.

9. If no such exception is thrown, proceed to delete the team.

10. Run the `Model#deleteTeam` method to remove the specified team from TeamBook.

11. `Model#deleteTeam` calls `TeamBook#removeTeamByName`, which in turn calls `UniqueTeamList#remove`. Finally, this method calls `ObservableList#remove` to remove the team from the list.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Where the teams are stored:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the teams in a separate class called `UniqueTeamList`.

    - Pros: Better use of object-oriented programming.
    - Cons: Multiple layers of abstraction (through Model, TeamBook, UniqueTeamList).

- **Alternative 2:** Store the teams in the same class as persons in the `AddressBook` class.

    - Pros: Easier implementation.
    - Cons: Breaks the principle of abstraction and object-oriented programming. Information hiding is also not maintained.

The choice between these alternatives depends on your specific project requirements and architectural preferences.
